This work was developed for the course TME131 - Project in Applied Mechanics, as part of the Applied Mechanics Master Program at Chalmers University of Technology.

In this repository, you will find the files that enable for design exploration of a pressel vessel section. The post-processed simulation jobs can be used to train and validate an Advanced Neural Network that is able to predict the von Mises stress field of the pressure vessel assembly. This ML model is embedded into a Genetic Algorithm for minimization of the mass of the pressure vessel.
